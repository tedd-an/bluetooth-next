Description: 	This write-only attribute allows users to trigger the vendor reset
		method on the Bluetooth device when arbitrary data is written.
		The reset may or may not be done through the device transport
		(e.g., UART/USB), and can also be done through an out-of-band
		approach such as GPIO.

Description: 	This attribute allows users to configure the USB Alternate setting
		for the specific HCI device. Reading this attribute returns the
		current setting, and writing any supported numbers would change
		the setting. See the USB Alternate setting definition in Bluetooth
		core spec 5, vol 4, part B, table 2.1.
		If the HCI device doesn't support USB Alternate setting
		configuration, the read/write fails with -ENODEV.
		If the data is not a valid number, the write fails with -EINVAL.
		The other failures are vendor specific.

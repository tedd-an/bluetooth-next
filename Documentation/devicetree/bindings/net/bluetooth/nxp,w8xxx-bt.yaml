title: NXP Bluetooth chips

description:
  This binding describes UART-attached NXP bluetooth chips.
  These chips are dual-radio chips supporting WiFi and Bluetooth,
  except for iw612, which is a tri-radio chip supporting 15.4
  as well.
  The bluetooth works on standard H4 protocol over 4-wire UART.
  The RTS and CTS lines are used during FW download.
  To enable power save mode, the host asserts break signal
  over UART-TX line to put the chip into power save state.
  De-asserting break wakes-up the BT chip.

	  This subsystem is designed to control power to devices that share
	  complex resources and/or require specific power sequences to be run
	  during power-up.

	  If unsure, say no.

	  Say U here to enable the power sequencing driver for Qualcomm
	  QCA6390.

	  The QCA6390 package contains the BT and WLAN modules whose power
	  is controlled by the PMU module. As the former two share the power-up
	  sequence which is executed by the PMU, this driver is needed for
	  correct power control.

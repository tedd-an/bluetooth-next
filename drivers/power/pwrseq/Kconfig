menuconfig PWRSEQ
	bool "Power Sequencer drivers"
	help
	  Provides support for special power sequencing drivers.

	  Say Y here to enable support for such devices

if PWRSEQ

config PWRSEQ_EMMC
	tristate "HW reset support for eMMC"
	default y
	depends on OF
	help
	  This selects Hardware reset support aka pwrseq-emmc for eMMC
	  devices. By default this option is set to y.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called pwrseq_emmc.

config PWRSEQ_QCA
	tristate "Power Sequencer for Qualcomm WiFi + BT SoCs"
	depends on OF
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for Qualcomm
	  WCN399x,QCA639x,QCA67xx families of hybrid WiFi and Bluetooth SoCs.
	  Note, this driver supports only power control for these SoC, you
	  still have to enable individual Bluetooth and WiFi drivers. This
	  driver is only necessary on ARM platforms with these chips. PCIe
	  cards handle power sequencing on their own.

	  Say M here if you want to include support for Qualcomm WiFi+BT SoCs
	  as a module. This will build a module called "pwrseq_qca".

config PWRSEQ_SD8787
	tristate "HW reset support for SD8787 BT + Wifi module"
	depends on OF
	help
	  This selects hardware reset support for the SD8787 BT + Wifi
	  module. By default this option is set to n.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called pwrseq_sd8787.

config PWRSEQ_SIMPLE
	tristate "Simple HW reset support"
	default y
	depends on OF
	help
	  This selects simple hardware reset support aka pwrseq-simple.
	  By default this option is set to y.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called pwrseq_simple.
